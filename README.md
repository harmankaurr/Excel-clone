# Excel-clone

A clone of the software MS - EXCEL that is used for storing and analyzing the data in tabular format.

In addition to the pre -existing features of MS-Excel, I have added more features like formula evaluation,formula cycle detection and cycle path tracing using CSS and DOM with storage, in a two way binding method.
